## Benchmark submission

To submit new benchmarks, simply send the new benchmarks to one of the SMT-LIB
maintainers [1].  We encourage to distribute benchmarks under the
Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,
but submitters can specify
their own licence in the benchmark itself using the
`(set-info :license "licence string")` command.

Detailed instructions for submitting benchmarks are available at [the SMT-LIB
pending benchmarks
repository](https://clc-gitlab.cs.uiowa.edu:2443/SMT-LIB-benchmarks-tmp/benchmarks-pending/-/blob/master/README.md).

Note that the people maintaining the SMT-LIB benchmarks are not in
general the same as the ones organizing the competition.


1. The SMT-LIB benchmark collection is co-managed by Clark Barrett, Pascal Fontaine, Aina Niemetz, Mathias Preiner, and Hans-JÃ¶rg Schurr ([source](https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/credits.shtml#players)).
