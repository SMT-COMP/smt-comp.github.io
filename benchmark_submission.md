## Benchmark submission

To submit new benchmarks, simply send the new benchmarks to one of the SMT-LIB
maintainers.  We encourage to distribute benchmarks under the
Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,
but submitters can specify
their own licence in the benchmark itself using the (set-info :license "licence string") command.

Detailed instructions for submitting benchmarks are available at [the SMT-LIB
pending benchmarks
repository](https://clc-gitlab.cs.uiowa.edu:2443/SMT-LIB-benchmarks-tmp/benchmarks-pending/-/blob/master/README.md).

Note that the people maintaining the SMT-LIB benchmarks are not in
general the same as the ones organizing the competition.
