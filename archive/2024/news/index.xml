Want the worldâ€™s best SMT solvers to compete to solve your problems? Submit your benchmarks to SMT-LIB and SMT-COMP!
Please let us know as soon as possible if you are considering submitting benchmarks, even if the material is not quite ready. We will work in close cooperation with the SMT-LIB maintainers to integrate such benchmarks into SMT-LIB.
