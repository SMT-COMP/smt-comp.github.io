## Machine Specifications

<p>
The competition will run on the <a href="http://www.starexec.org">Star-Exec</a> cluster of machines at
<a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/">The University of Iowa</a>.
</p>
<p>
The machines have these specifications:
<PRE>
# Starexec stats nodes 0 - 32:
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2609 0 @ 2.40GHz (2393 MHZ)
    10240  KB Cache
    129022 MB main memory

# Starexec stats nodes 33 - 192:
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2609 0 @ 2.40GHz (2393 MHZ)
    10240  KB Cache
    258294 MB main memory

# Software:
OS:	Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.3 (Santiago)
kernel:	2.6.32-431.1.2.el6.x86_64
glibc:	gcc-4.4.6-4.el6.x86_64
	        glibc-2.12-1.132.el6.i686
</PRE>
The machines have 2 processors each and 4 cores per processor.
For the competition, only one job-pair will be run on a given machine at a given time, on one processor, with 4 cores available, and the available memory will be capped at 129022MB.

<p><b>
However, please note that we may make software and configuration changes
before the competition. As part of setting up the solvers, the solvers
will be exercized on a few benchmarks to be sure they run successfully.
