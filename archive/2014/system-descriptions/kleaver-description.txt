Kleaver is the constraint solver of the symbolic execution tool KLEE.
It uses a series of mathematical simplifications, an optimisation that
groups constraints into independent subsets, and subset-superset
caching, after which (if still needed) invokes an underlying SMT
solver. These optimizations are described in more detail in
[EXE-CCS-06], [KLEE-OSDI-08] and [MultiSolver-CAV-13]. The competition
version has caching disabled (since it is only beneficial when
sequences of queries are issued), and uses STP (the default solver of
KLEE) as the underlying SMT solver. The portfolio version of Kleaver
employs Boolector, STP and Z3 through the metaSMT solver
framework [MetaSMT-DIFTS-11].

Kleaver is available as open-source as part of KLEE, and can be
downloaded from http://klee.github.io/klee/. It was originally built as
part of the [KLEE-OSDI-08] project and extended since by the members of
the Software Reliability Group at Imperial College London and the
wider KLEE developer community.
