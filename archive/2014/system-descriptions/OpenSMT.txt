OpenSMT is an open-source SMT solver developed at the University of
Lugano.  The new version, OpenSMT2, is a newcomer to the family of SMT
solvers, even though it owes much of its performance to the previous
versions of the solver.

OpenSMT2 now has a new term handling functionality that allows a
complete separation between theory specific parts and the structure of
the problem, while still maintaining all the optimizations present in
the previous version.  The support for the smtlib2 standard has been
built in to the solver in a way that in future allows expanding the
range of supported theories in a natural way that previously was not
possible.

At the moment the solver implements the theory of quantifier-free
uninterpreted functions with equalities (QF_UF).  The implementation
handles the memory used by the critical data structures in a custom way,
giving an average of 15% boost to the wall-clock performance compared to
its predecessor in the operations related to these data structures.

The solver has been thoroughly tested for both performance and
correctness.  While the version competing in the SMT-COMP 2014 still
suffers from certain inefficiencies, such as a naive implementation of
theory propagation, it is already in many respects comparable to the
state-of-the-art in its field.
