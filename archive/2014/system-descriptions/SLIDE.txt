SLIDE is a tool for deciding entailments between two given predicates,
from a larger system of inductively defined predicates, written in an
existential fragment of Separation Logic. The proof method relies on
converting both the left hand and right hand sides of the entailment
into two tree automata AutLHS and AutRHS, respectively, and checking
the tree language inclusion of the automaton AutLHS in the automaton
AutRHS.
