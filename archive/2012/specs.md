## Machine Specifications


The competition will run on a cluster of 11 machines at
<a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/">The University of Iowa</a>.
For SMT-COMP 2012, the specifications of these machines are:

Nine are 2.4 GHz AMD Opteron 250s, configured for single core, 64-bit processing

- 1 MB cache
- 4 GB main memory

Two are 2.53 GHz Intel Xeon E5540s, configured for single core, 64-bit processing

- 8 MB cache
- 12 GB main memory

All eleven execution nodes have the same software configuration:

- Linux, kernel version 2.6.18-128.2.1.el5
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Client release 5.2 (Tikanga)
- glibc-2.5-24.el5_2.2
- runtime libraries from gcc-4.1.2-42.el5

<b>
However, please note that we may make software and configuration changes
before the competition.  When you submit your solver for
SMT-COMP through the SMT-Exec service,
it is checked for compatibility with the competition infrastructure on simple
benchmarks supported by your solver.
</b>

Note that the organizers had expected the Star-Exec service to be ready for
the 2012 competition; the Star-Exec service would have provided considerably
more resources. However, development delays have required us (as of mid-May
2012) to plan to use SMT-Exec again this year.
