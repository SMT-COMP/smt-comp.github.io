<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="decision-procedures">Decision procedures.</h3>
<p>Decision procedures for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) are of
continuing interest for many verification applications. SMT solvers are
typically used for verification as backends: a verification problem or
subproblem is translated into an SMT formula and submitted to the SMT
solver. The solver then attempts to report satisfiability or
unsatisfiability of the formula. The advantage SMT solvers are usually
considered to have over pure SAT solvers, which are also often used as
verification backends (e.g., for bounded model checking), is the higher
level of abstraction at which they can operate.  By implementing
theories like arithmetic, arrays, and uninterpreted functions directly,
SMT solvers have the promise to provide higher performance than SAT
solvers working on encodings of such structures to the bit level.</p>

<h3 id="standard-formats">Standard formats.</h3>
<p>The additional promise of SMT over pure SAT is balanced by additional
challenges. Since SMT deals with first-order (most commonly
quantifier-free) formulas instead of purely propositional ones, creation
and widespread adoption of a common input language is more difficult
than for SAT. It is furthermore more important, since the more
expressive setting of SMT potentially allows more room for variation in
the exact details of the logic (e.g., sorted or unsorted, total or
partial functions, etc.). Hence, translations between input formats of
different tools are more complex, and in some cases it may even not be
clear what such a translation should be. This makes the issue of input
format critical. For combination with other tools like skeptical proof
assistants (requiring a proof of every theorem validated by an external
tool), common output formats for objects like proofs and models are also
necessary for the adoption of SMT.</p>

<h3 id="competition">Competition.</h3>
<p>The Satisfiability Modulo Theories Competition (SMT-COMP) arose from the
<a href="https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/">SMT-LIB</a> (Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library)
initiative to spur adoption of the common, community-designed SMT-LIB formats,
and to spark further advances in SMT, especially for verification. Competitions
in other automated reasoning fields, such as
<a href="http://www.tptp.org/CASC/">CASC competition</a> and the
<a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/">SAT competition</a>,
have helped inspire continuing improvements in tools from year to year.<br />
The first SMT-COMP was held in 2005 as a satellite event of the
<a href="http://www.cav2005.inf.ed.ac.uk/">17th International Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV 2005)</a>.
The experience with SMT-COMP 2005 confirmed the communityâ€™s expectations that a
public competition would indeed motivate implementors of SMT solvers to adopt
the common SMT-LIB input format.  <a href="previous.html">Subsequent SMT-COMPs</a> have
provided further evidence that such a competition can stimulate improvement in
solver implementations: solvers entered in each competition have improved
significantly over those in previous competitions.</p>
